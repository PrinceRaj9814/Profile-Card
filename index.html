                    <h3>Light Yagami</h3>
                    <p class="card-description">
                        Light Yagami begins as a brilliant, idealistic student who believes the world is rotten with crime. When he discovers the "Death Note" — a notebook that can kill anyone whose name is written in it — he sees it as a tool to create a “perfect” world. At first, his goal seems noble: eliminate criminals and protect the innocent.
                        <br>
                        However, as his power grows, so does his ego. Light starts to see himself not as a human, but as a god — judge, jury, and executioner. Anyone who opposes him, including investigators and even innocent people, becomes an enemy to be eliminated. Step by step, his sense of justice twists into obsession, and his fear of being caught outweighs his concern for human life.
                        <br>
                        By the end, Light's transformation is complete. The boy who wanted to save the world becomes its greatest villain, proving that absolute power doesn't just corrupt—it reveals who you truly are.
